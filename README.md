# E-Payment
Final year project 

We propose a new method for E-payment that provides unrivaled security by using cryptographic techniques visual cryptography, quantum cryptography and steganography. Visual cryptography hides the authentication details of customer by generating two shares for customer and bank respectively. Quantum cryptography secures the transmission of one time password. Steganography is used to combine the customer’s share along with one time password in order to secure the transmission of customer’s share to bank .Proposed method for E-shopping can be extended for other bank applications.
